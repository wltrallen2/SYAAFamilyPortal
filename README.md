This project was developed as a rehearsal management app for the directors and actors at the Strauss Youth Academy for the Arts in northeast Louisiana. The app allows parents and students to see customized rehearsal schedules for the theatrical productions in which they were involved, and allows them to submit rehearsal conflicts to the directing team so that they would know when actors were not available to rehearse.

The app was connected to a custom-built backend through an API built in PHP in a separate repository.
